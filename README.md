# Enumerable Module

The enumerable module is one of ruby's defining modules. It gives programmers powerful tools like select, find, and map. 

In this lab, we'll be creating our own class and adding the enumerable module to it.

## Person, Dog, and Adults
We'll be creating 3 classes. `Person`, `Dog`, and `Adults`

The adults class is where we'll be mixing in the Enumerable class. 

## Yielding human adults
The Adults class can have both people and dogs added to it. You will define an #each method that only yields actual adults; Person objects over the age of 18. 

## Order
Complete the Dog and Person class first since Adults uses them both.
